## Required

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.


## Procedures
1) The app.js file must be linked at the end of the html section.
2) One more section is added to the html content to make them 4 sections as required.
3) Started working on the navigation bar, and created it dynamically using JS.
4) Worked on the active section functionality which gives the active class to the section currently being viewed.
5) Finally the scrolling functionality instead of jumping right to the section.

## Final representation
Finally we have an interactive landing page where as per the rubric, we have a navbar which has section buttons that scrolls you down to the targeted section when clicked , and the active section is highlighted when viewed.
